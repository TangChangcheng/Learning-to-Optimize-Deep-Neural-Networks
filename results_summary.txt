6_mom_infnorm
6_mom_loss_150k_1e-3: fastest at start, diverges
6_mom_loss_150k_5e-4: fast at start, lowest at end
6_mom_loss_150k_1e-4, 6_mom_loss_400k_1.1_1e-4, 
6_mom_loss_850k_5e-4: fast at start, lowest at end

6_mom_sq
400k_1e-3: fastest, overall
400k_5e-4: 2nd best
500k_5e-3: 3rd
400k_1e-4: slow at start, but still gets to a somewhat good end
500k_5e-4(default): worst

6_mom_125
150k_5e-4: Same as 1000k_1e-3
150k_1e-3: slightly faster, but overall 2nd best
150k_1e-4: worst
1000k_1e-4: 2nd worst at start, but becomes almost as good as the best one
1000k_5e-4: A bit slow at start, but overall best
1000k_1e-3: A bit fast at start, but overall 2nd best.

6_mom_delta
900k 1e-4: a bit slow at start, but best overall, performance doesnt imporve when learning 
           rate is increased
900k 5e-5: slight faster at start, but then dies out.

6_mom_noise_inf
50k_1e-4: worst
50k_5e-4: 2nd best
50k_1e-3: Almost the same as 400k_5e-4, but at the end slightly worse, 
          decrease step size at the end?
400k_5e-4: Best
400k_1e-3: 2nd Best
400k_1e-4: Worst

6_mom_sq_noise:
550k_1e-4: Worst
550k_5e-4: 2nd Best, a bit slow at start, but then approaches the best curve
550k_1e-3: Best

using noise measuer helped a lot in the end in particular, In the start they performed equally 
well as noiseless versoin. Noise inf norm slower than noise less sqnorm at start but noise 
inf norm eventually achieves the same performance as sq noise.
Overall sq noise is the best one yet. using delta mv it was slow at start but crosses even 
the mom_loss_150k. Using 1.25 as step also seems to give some advantage at the end.

so combine 1.25, deltamv, and sq noise. 
Also try and see what happens as learning rate is tapered off. 
And find out the average distance in default and increased step cases.
